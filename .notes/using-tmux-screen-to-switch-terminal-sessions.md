⏺ To switch to a window
running a Claude command,
you'll need to use
terminal/window management
tools. Here are several
approaches:

## Using tmux (recommended)

```bash
# List tmux sessions
  tmux list-sessions

  # Attach to specific 
  session
  tmux attach-session -t
  session_name

  # Switch between tmux 
  sessions
  tmux switch-client -t
  session_name
```

## Using screen

```bash
# List screen sessions
  screen -ls

  # Resume specific screen 
  session
  screen -r session_name
```

## Using `ps` and `terminal` switching

```bash
# Find Claude processes
  ps aux | grep claude

  # For iTerm2, switch to 
  specific window
  osascript -e 'tell 
  application "iTerm" to 
  activate'
```

## Using pgrep for process management

```bash
# Find Claude process ID
  pgrep -f claude

  # Get terminal window info
  lsof -p $(pgrep -f claude) | grep /dev/ttys
```

## macOS-specific window switching

```bash
# Switch to Terminal app
  osascript -e 'tell 
  application "Terminal" to 
  activate'

  # Switch to specific 
  Terminal window by index
  osascript -e 'tell 
  application "Terminal" to 
  set frontmost of window 1 
  to true'
```

The most reliable approach
is using `tmux` or `screen`
session management, as they
maintain persistent
sessions you can easily
switch between.

**Progress**

So, tmux was not installed.

Used `brew` to install it.
trying to run `tmux list-sessions` gives

```bash
error connecting to /private/tmp/tmux-503/default (No such file or directory)

⏺ The error means you don't have any tmux sessions running yet. When there are no active
  sessions, tmux can't connect to its socket file.

  Here's how to get started:

  Create your first tmux session

  # Start a new tmux session
  tmux new-session -s claude-session

  # Or shorter version
  tmux new -s claude-session

  Basic tmux workflow

  # Start tmux session and run Claude
  tmux new -s claude-session
  # (now you're inside tmux)
  claude

  # Detach from session (Ctrl+b, then d)
  # Or from outside tmux:
  tmux detach-session -s claude-session

  # List sessions (now this will work)
  tmux list-sessions

  # Reattach to session
  tmux attach -s claude-session

  Key tmux commands

  - Ctrl+b then d - detach from session
  - Ctrl+b then c - create new window
  - Ctrl+b then n - next window
  - Ctrl+b then p - previous window

  The error you saw is normal - tmux only creates the socket file when you have active
  sessions running.
```
